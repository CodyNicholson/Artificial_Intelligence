# Constraint Propagation

If you've made it this far, you've already gained hands on exposure to a powerful technique in AI - Constraint Propagation. Constraint Propagation is all about using local constraints in a space (in the case of Sudoku, the constraints of each square) to dramatically reduce the search space. As we enforce each constraint, we see how it introduces new constraints for other parts of the board that can help us further reduce the number of possibilities. We have an entire lesson devoted to Constraint Propagation but let's quickly see some other famous AI problems it helps us solve.

### Map Coloring

![alt tag](imgs/map-coloring.jpg)

No two adjacent items can be the same color in the map coloring problem.

In the map coloring problem, we must find a way to color the map such that no two adjacent items share the same color. Indeed, we'll see how we use constraint propagation to use this simple constraint to find a solution just as we use such constraints to solve Sudoku.

### Crypto-Arithmetic Puzzles

In Crypto-Arithmetic puzzles, each letter represents a digit, and no two letters represent the same digit. None of the numbers start with a leading zero. Our goal is to find a mapping from letters to digits that satisfies the equations. Here again, we'll find that the constraints imposed by the equation allow us to create an intelligent algorithm to solve the problem via Constraint Propagation.

Now that you see how we apply Constraint Propagation to this problem, let's try to code it! In the following quiz, combine the functions eliminate and only_choice to write the function reduce_puzzle, which receives as input an unsolved puzzle and applies our two constraints repeatedly in an attempt to solve it.
