#Anaconda & Jupyter Notebooks

This is a class I took on Udacity to learn how to use Anaconda & Jupyter Notebooks so I could complete the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

Anaconda is an environment manager that makes it easy to manage the dependencies of many different python projects all at the same time without conflicts
