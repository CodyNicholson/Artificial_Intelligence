# Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles

A **Hamiltonian Path** is an undirected or directed graph that visits each *vertex* exactly once

A **Hamiltonian Cycle** is a Hamiltonian Path that is a cycle

### Traveling Salesman Problem

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

If the graph of cities has a Hamiltonian Path and Cycle, then that is the solution for the traveling salesmen problem
