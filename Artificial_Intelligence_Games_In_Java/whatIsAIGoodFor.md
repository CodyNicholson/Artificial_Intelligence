# What Is AI Good For?

- There are the heavy artificial intelligence related methods such as machine learning or neural networks

- Artificial Intelligence is also useful for optimization-related problems

- Search algorithms

- Graph Algorithms like Breadth-First-Search and Depth-First-Search

- Heuristics

- Meta-heuristics like genetics algorithms, particle swarm optimization method and simulated annealing

###### Heuristics- enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves

***

## Robotics

- You want to move robots to explore Mars, for example

- You will need shortest path algorithms to make the maneuvers as efficient as possible

- IDDFS, A* search

-

## Optimizations

- If you want to make some complex optimizations or want to find some optimal state, for example: To reduce noise in electric devices

- If you have to make very complex simulations

- Search space is enormous and traditional optimization techniques are becoming very slow, so AI helps there too

- Used for genetic algorithms and particle swarm intelligence, NASA uses genetic algorithms to find the optimal geometry of antenna

- Used to train neural networks

-

## Chess

- AI is useful for creating perfect players for tic-tac-toe, go, or chess

- You have to construct the game tree (which is enormous): a good approach is to prune the branches that are unnecessary

- Alpha-beta pruning

-

## Neural Networks

- Mimic the human brain itself

- Can yield very good predictions - like stock markets

- Optimization for transistors
