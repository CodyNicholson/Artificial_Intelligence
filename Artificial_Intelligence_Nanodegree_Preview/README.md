# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Preview

Udacity offered a preview of their artificial intelligence nanodegree program that I participated in:

We know you may be curious about the content and experience of the program, so we created this mini-experience as a way for you to get a taste of what to expect in the program as a whole. In this course you'll preview all of the content from the first week of class, up to the first project.

After you look through all the material, we hope you are excited to join us in the actual classroom. When you're ready, visit www.udacity.com/ai to apply today. Or, if you've already been admitted, head back to your e-mail to enroll now.

We'll see you in class!
