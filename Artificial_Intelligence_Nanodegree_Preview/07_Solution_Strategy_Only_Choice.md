# Solution Strategy Two: Only Choice

Every unit must contain exactly one occurrence of every number

So, these are the values we obtain when we apply the function **eliminate**

If there is only one box in a unit which would allow a certain digit, then that box must be assigned that digit

utils.py

```python
rows = 'ABCDEFGHI'
cols = '123456789'

def cross(a, b):
    return [s+t for s in a for t in b]

boxes = cross(rows, cols)

row_units = [cross(r, cols) for r in rows]
column_units = [cross(rows, c) for c in cols]
square_units = [cross(rs, cs) for rs in ('ABC','DEF','GHI') for cs in ('123','456','789')]
unitlist = row_units + column_units + square_units
units = dict((s, [u for u in unitlist if s in u]) for s in boxes)
peers = dict((s, set(sum(units[s],[]))-set([s])) for s in boxes)

def display(values):
    """
    Display the values as a 2-D grid.
    Input: The sudoku in dictionary form
    Output: None
    """
    width = 1+max(len(values[s]) for s in boxes)
    line = '+'.join(['-'*(width*3)]*3)
    for r in rows:
        print(''.join(values[r+c].center(width)+('|' if c in '36' else '')
                      for c in cols))
        if r in 'CF': print(line)
    return

    """

    chars = []
    digits = '123456789'
    for c in grid:
        if c in digits:
            chars.append(c)
        if c == '.':
            chars.append(digits)
    assert len(chars) == 81
    return dict(zip(boxes, chars))

```

function.py

```python
from utils import *

def only_choice(values):
    """Finalize all values that are the only choice for a unit.

    Go through all the units, and whenever there is a unit with a value
    that only fits in one box, assign the value to this box.

    Input: Sudoku in dictionary form.
    Output: Resulting Sudoku in dictionary form after filling in only choices.
    """
    for unit in unitlist:
        for digit in '123456789':
            dplaces = [box for box in unit if digit in values[box]]
            if len(dplaces) == 1:
                values[dplaces[0]] = digit
    return values

```

The above code works sometimes, but there are still Sudokus that it cannot solve
