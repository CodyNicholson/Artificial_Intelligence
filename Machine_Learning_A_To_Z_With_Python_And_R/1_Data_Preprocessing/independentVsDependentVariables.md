#Independent Vs Dependent Variables

Take this dataset for example:

| Country | Age | Salary | Purchased |
|:------- | ---:| ------:| ---------:|
| France  | 44  | 72000  | No        |
| Spain   | 27  | 48000  | Yes       |
| Germany | 30  | 54000  | No        |
| Spain   | 38  | 61000  | No        |
| Germany | 40  |        | Yes       |
| France  | 35  | 58000  | Yes       |
| Spain   |     | 52000  | No        |
| France  | 48  | 79000  | Yes       |
| Germany | 50  | 83000  | No        |
| France  | 37  | 67000  | Yes       |

The first three columns are the independent variables, and the last column is the depandent variable

In every machine learning model, we are going to use some independent variables to predict a dependent variable
