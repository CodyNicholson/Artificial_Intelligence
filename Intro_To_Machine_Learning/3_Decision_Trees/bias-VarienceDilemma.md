# Bias-Variance Dilemma

A **high-biased** machine learning algorithm is one that practically ignores the data, it has almost no capacity to learn anything

A biased self-driving car is a self-driving car that you can train and then after training it - it will stop learning things

A **high-variance** machine learning algorithm is one that learns all the time and is constantly changing in the way it behaves relative to what it learns

You have to have a tradeoff between bias and variance so that your algorithm will know when it needs to learn and when it needs to continue doing what it is doing
