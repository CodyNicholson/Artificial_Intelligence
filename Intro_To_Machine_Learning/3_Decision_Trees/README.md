# Decision Trees

Decision Trees are really easy to use, they graphically allow you to interpret the data really well, you can understand their results much better than the results of a Support Vector Machine (for example). You can build bigger classifiers out of decision trees in something called ensemble methods. 

They are prone to over-fitting especially when you have data with lots of features and a complicated decision tree. You have to be careful with the parameter tunes that you are picking when you use the decision tree to prevent this from happening. You need to stop the growth of the tree at the approperiate time so that you never have a branch with only one node.
