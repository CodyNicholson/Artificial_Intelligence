# Naive Bayes

The supervised machine learning algorithm **Naive Bayes** is easy to implement, has a very large feature space (For example, it is used a lot for language machine learning where there are thousands of words in the English language that each represent a different feature), it is also a very efficient algorithm.

Naive Bayes can break in strange ways. For example, when used with Google search engine, if you searched "Chicago Bulls" the algorithm would return to you articles relating the Chicago and Bulls, not the sport team - it cannot understand phrases that encompass multiple words.
