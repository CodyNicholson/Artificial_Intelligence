# Supervised Classification

**Supervised** means that you are given a lot of examples

**Supervised Classification** is a technique we use to teach machines by providing them with a large quantity of examples

In the case of self-driving cars, we teach the car how to drive by letting it watch how we drive for a very long time

Gradually the car begins to be able to mimic our behavior and drive like us

***

### In which of the following cases should we use Supervised Classification?

1. From an album of tagged photos, recognize someone in a picture

2. Analyze bank data for weird-looking transactions and flag those for fraud

3. Given someone's music choices and a bunch of features of that music (tempo, genre, etc) recommend a new song

4. Cluster students into types based on learning styles

Option 1 and 3 are correct because you are given an album of tagged photos and someons's music choices

In Option 2 and 4 you are not given any examples for the program to learn from, so it is not supervised learning
