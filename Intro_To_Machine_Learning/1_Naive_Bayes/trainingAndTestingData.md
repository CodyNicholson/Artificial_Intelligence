# Training And Testing Data

Always try to train and test on two different sets of data

If you train and test on the same data, you have not proved anything but that your program can read your original data

Your program has to be useful in the real world, and in the real world there is always new data your program will have to handle - giving your program different sets of data is a must when it comes to training your program
