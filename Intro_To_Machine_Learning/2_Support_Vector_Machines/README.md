#Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM's work really well in complicated domains where there is a clear margin of separation

They do not preform so well in very large datasets because the training time happens to be cubic in the size of the data set (SVM's would be very slow in this case and prone to overfitting)

They also do not work well when there is lots of "noise" - when the classes are overlapping a lot you have to count independent evidence (Naive Bayes would work best in this case)
