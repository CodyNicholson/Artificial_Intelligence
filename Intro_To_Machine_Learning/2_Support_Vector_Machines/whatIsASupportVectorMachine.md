# What Is A Support Vector Machine

A **Support Vector Machine**, or SVM, is an algorithm that is used to draw a line on a scatterplot that maximizes the distance to the nearest point of either class

That means if you are training your classifier to pick out music that you like and you create a scatterplot that represents the relationship between the feature tempo and the feature singer gender, then the SVM algorithm will draw the best *Decision Surface* line that will separate the songs you do like from the songs you done

The distance that an SVM line creates (that maximizes the distance to the nearest point of either class) is called the **Margin** - It is the distance between the line and the nearest point of either class
